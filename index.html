          <h1>Spanish Paella Valenciana</h>
          <p>If you’re a fan of meat, veggies, and herbs, you’ll love this classic Spanish rice dish. It takes some time to make, but it has so much flavor, not to mention a ton of protein.
              You’ll use both chicken and rabbit; then, you’ll add butter beans, green beans, 
              and frozen green peas. That’s enough to keep anyone fully sated for hours.</p>

          <h2>Indian Butter Chicken</h>
          <p>If you’re looking for a warm, savory dish to enjoy on a cold night, you can’t beat this traditional Indian staple.
             The chicken is tender, and the sauce is creamy, buttery, and totally scrumptious. Plus, 
             this yummy curry and rice dish takes less than 40 minutes to make!
            Serve it with one of these delicious butter chicken side dishes for a complete meal.</p>

          <h3>Italian Margherita Pizza</h>
          <p>Although it may not be as popular in the United States as, say, a Meat Lover’s Supreme, the Italian Margherita is one of Italy’s most famous pizzas.
            The crust is chewy and perfectly crispy around the edges, the mozzarella is supremely gooey, and the pizza sauce has a tangy, garlicky flavor that everyone loves.</p>
        <p>Throw a few basil leaves on top, and you’re all done. Sorry to all my meat-loving friends; this one is 100% vegetarian.
          Of course, you can easily add other toppings if you like, but it won’t be an authentic Margherita pizza if you do. 
          Still, you’re the one eating it, so fix it however you like.</p>

          <h4>Chinese Yangzhou Rice</h>
          <p>If you’re looking for a quick and easy but surprisingly filling meal, Yangzhou fried rice is hard to beat. Other than salt and pepper, it uses just nine ingredients.
            The prep time is a simple five minutes, and it only takes 10 more to cook everything. It doesn’t matter what your 
            favorite Chinese restaurant is; this fried rice can rival theirs. You have my word on that.</p>

          <h5>Korean Bibimbap</h>
          <p>For some reason, authentic Korean recipes aren’t as popular in America as some of the other Asian cuisines on our list.
            Many people know nothing about it outside of Korean barbecue, and some don’t even know that!
            This Korean bibimbap is a unique and delectable introduction to the world of Korean cuisine. It takes some time to pull together, but it’s worth it, I promise.
            It’s ridiculously flavorful, features tender, juicy steak, and has plenty of hearty veggies, as well. The sauce is also amazing, and you’ll want to put it on everything.

          <h6>Japanese Sushi Rolls</h>
          <p>I’m pretty sure sushi is one of those internationally loved foods you’ll find almost everywhere. And though you might not think to make it yourself, I highly recommend giving it a go.
            Most of the work in this recipe goes into the rice, and even that’s pretty easy to make. If sushi is something you love, 
            you’ll enjoy being able to make it at home and save money.</p>

          <h7>Thai Pad Thai</h>
          <p>Despite how complicated and involved Pad Thai looks, it takes only half an hour to make. Who needs takeout when you can whip up something just as delicious in only 30 minutes?
            This recipe combines all the sweet, savory, and tangy flavors you’d expect, but it uses chicken instead of seafood, which some people prefer.
            I think the chicken gives it a lighter, less overpowering flavor, and it pairs perfectly with the slippery, scrumptious noodles.

          <h8>American Hamburger</h>
          <p>The hamburger is a staple of American fast food and backyard grilling. But believe it or not, there are plenty of ways for this classic American dish to go wrong.
            So, start with a great recipe – like this one – and you should be just fine.
            It features a quarter-pound ground beef pattie, two slices of American cheese, and two pieces of thick, salty bacon.
            Pile it high with all your favorite toppings, and enjoy!</p>

          <h9>Irish Calcannon Potatos</h>
          <p>If the only experience you have with mashed potatoes is from a powdered mix in a box, you’re truly missing out.
              And with these Irish colcannon potatoes, even homemade mashed taters fall short.
              These are fluffy and unbelievably buttery. Add in a bit of garlic powder if you like a touch more flavor.</p>

          <h10>French Beef Bourguignon</h>
          <p>Beef bourguignon is so tender and juicy that it practically melts the moment it hits your tongue. And that’s just from the meat and the red wine sauce.
            You’ll also add carrots, onions, garlic, and more, making this already incredible meal even more flavorful and phenomenal.
            Beef bourguignon is a meal the whole family will love. However, it tastes so good that you may not want to share!</p>
